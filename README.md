# b29-tools [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rjackson90/b29-tools.svg?branch=dev)](https://travis-ci.org/rjackson90/b29-tools)

A web app to simplify playing Legion Games' B-29 Superfortress. The game's many charts are implemented in Haskell
as a REST API which returns JSON data back to the client. The client HTML page uses AngularJS and Bootstrap to
provide a nice user interface, and do things like remember the user's selections from chart to chart. 

## Status
This project is still undergoing initial development. As such, the API is (very) unstable and not guaranteed to be
documented. This project follows [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

## Reference Deployment
I have deployed b29-tools on my personal web server. It can be accessed at http://b29.rcjsoftware.com
